# Team: MeetingBot
This Bot can be integrated in order to find an adequate location for meeting up. Given two locations (the locations of the interaction partners) we find you a venue for a meeting near the halfway point between you. 
Possible Extensions:
* A Chat-Bot like version, where you can write the locations as a message and get the venue as a message back.
* More than 2 locations
