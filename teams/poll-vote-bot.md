A [WebOfNeeds](https://github.com/researchstudio-sat/webofneeds)-Bot which allows users to participate in exisiting polls (by voting) from the plattform strawpoll.me. The user can choose the option to vote for via an interactive chat with the bot.

* In addition to that, the [CoopBot](https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/won-coopbot) uses atoms to vote in polls for one of their usecases.
