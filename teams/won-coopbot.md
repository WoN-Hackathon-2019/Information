We create a groupchat bot, that is able to find the nearest place for meetup and play football for all group members.

## EasyCLI
[EasyCli Repository](https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/easycli)

We created a simple utils-project to parse string commands conveniently.

# Cooperations

For voting for the best place to play football we cooperate with the PollCreateBot (https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/won-pollcreaterbot)
