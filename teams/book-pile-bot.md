# Projects
## Book Crawler
Our bot reacts to user book needs, crawls search results from https://buechereien.wien.gv.at/ related to the need and generates atoms for each of them.

You can interact with the bot in two ways:
* generate an atom "Look for something" and relate it to books
* connect with the bots atom and write him which book you are looking for

# Cooperations
The [BookMatchBot](https://github.com/orgs/WoN-Hackathon-2019/teams/bookmatchbot)
uses our generated atoms to match with user generated atoms searching for books.

Further more, we used their BookAtomModelWrapper and extended it.
